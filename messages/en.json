    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "items": [
      {
        "question": "What is Genmoji?",
        "answer": "Genmoji is a new feature of Apple Intelligence that lets users create custom genmojis — called Genmoji. Genmoji is available on iOS 18.2 or later on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and all iPhone 16 models."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is genmojionline.com?",
        "answer": "Genmojionline.com is a website that allows you to create custom genmojis, similar to Apple's Genmoji, but without the need for an iOS device. You can generate unique genmojis using text-based prompts, and then use them on various social media platforms."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is genmojionline.com different from Apple's Genmoji?",
        "answer": "The primary difference is that genmojionline.com is not limited to Apple devices. You can use it on any device with a web browser. Apple's Genmoji is a feature of Apple Intelligence and is only available on devices updated to iOS 18 or later. Our site aims to provide the same functionality but with broader accessibility."
      },
      {
        "question": "What technology does genmojionline.com use?",
        "answer": "Our site uses an image generation model, similar to Flux 1 Dev, which is fine-tuned using a large dataset of genmojis. We use a language model (LLM) to make your prompt more descriptive, which improves the quality of the generated image. We also use background removal and resizing processes similar to Apple's methods."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I create an genmoji on genmoji online?",
        "answer": "You create genmojis by typing a few words or a phrase into the \"Describe an genmoji\" box. The website uses this prompt to generate unique genmojis. Use simple, descriptive keywords for the best results, avoid long sentences."
      },
      {
        "question": "What kind of prompts work best?",
        "answer": "- Simple, descriptive prompts using keywords work best. Avoid long sentences\n- You can specify colors, styles, and actions, such as \"a red cat with a hat\"\n- Try adding the word \"explosion\" to create more dynamic and interesting genmojis"
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use my own photos to create Genmoji?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can use photos of yourself or others to create Genmoji by uploading the image to our website. You can also customize the person's clothing, actions and emotions in the prompt.\n\n- The Feature is currently in beta and only available for a limited number of users."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use the genmojis I create as stickers?",
        "answer": "Yes, the genmojis you generate can be used like stickers in messaging apps. In some apps, they may also appear like normal genmojis alongside text."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are Genmoji genmojis free to use?",
        "answer": "Yes! All genmojis created with Genmoji Online are free to use. You retain full rights to your generated genmojis and can use them for personal or commercial purposes without attribution or copyright concerns."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I use my Genmojis?",
        "answer": "Genmojis are compatible with all major platforms including Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, and social media. You can download them in various formats and use them anywhere you want to express yourself."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does my Genmoji look different from what I expected?",
        "answer": "Genmoji generation is creative and experimental, and sometimes you will not get the result you were hoping for. Keep swiping to see other options, or refine the prompt slightly. If using a photo of a person, ensure the photo is well-lit and focused. You can also use the editor to try different versions of the person in the photo."
